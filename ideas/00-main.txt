I want to build the application
call it crystal.
and learn new language RUST
with best practice of the using LLM,
and share my experience by create a series of the videos for youtube. 
Build step by step plan (one answer one step), what is best way to release this idea.
here  the application should be:
- on rust language
- allow to keep hands on keyboard for any operations
- use interface style like zellij https://zellij.dev/documentation/
- allow to use plugins
- UX should have:
  - Keyboard shortcuts (hide in config)
  - Help screens
- main functions should allow to implement same as:
  - https://lenshq.io/products/lens-k8s-ide
  - https://k9scli.io/
- must have features:
  - "Cluster-Aware" Internal Terminal ( it should pre-configure the environment (KUBECONFIG/Context) )
  -  "exec" and "logs" features are part of a broader Context-Aware Terminal
- lower level priority feauters:
  - benchmark HTTP services and pods directly within the UI to help adjust resource requests and limits
  - logic to automatically detect and connect to cloud-provider clusters (EKS, GKE, AKS)
  - AI-Powered Assistance
  - "XRay" and "Pulse" views to allow users to visualize dependencies and get a high-level "state of affairs" for the cluster
the plan should be well readable for AI tools like claudecode/codex/gemini
to keep small context window during development
so split the document on stages.
